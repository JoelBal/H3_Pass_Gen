# H3_Pass_Gen


During this assignement I was able to add the correct Java Script to create the password generator
I started with creating Variable for the character options in the generator.
Then I added the arrays with the characters for the generator.
When that was done a passwordlenth variable was added to give the password length a range from 8-128
The prompt is will ask to select one character choice
As long as one of your 4 choices are selected a password will appear in the generator
